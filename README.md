# JavaShoppingBasket

This is a coding test from CodeClan. 

## The Brief
You have been asked to model a shopping basket.

You must be able to:

add items to the shopping basket,
remove items from the shopping basket,
empty the shopping basket.
Additionally, you must be able to calculate the total value of the shopping basket including discounts. Discounts are applied in the following order:

buy-one-get-one-free offers
10% off on totals greater than Â£20
2% off on total for customers with loyalty cards
You must be able to validate that the code works through passing tests.

We will be looking for evidence of 'solid' coding techniques and test driven development.
